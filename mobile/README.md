# QQueue App

## Overview

The aim of QQueue app is to streamline the queuing process for all types of stores in Singapore, by providing an island-wide queue management system. We seek to design the first mobile application in Singapore providing live updates on the queue status of various stores in Singapore and remote queuing all via a single avenue.
QQueue serves three main purposes:

1. Providing users with up-to-date queue information on various stores across Singapore
2. Allowing users to join and leave queues of locations remotely
3. Allowing Service-Providers to gain publicity and better management of their customer queue
